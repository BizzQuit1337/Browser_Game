### Flavour text ###
This is the frame work for a browser game that will be taking inpiration from ogame
this is a light framework to make sure all the pages have correct functionality aswell
as genreal layout.

All styling is done in the index.css sheet.

More files will be added as the game grows and progresses.

### Notes ###
The idea of this game is to make a functional browser game in which the user progresses from
the stoneage to the modern era, the game will be a clicker game. The current version of the game 
will be single player but aiming to be a multiplayer game in which players compete against 
each other.

This game has only just begun and will hopefully keep progressing from humble beginings to
the next AAA title (gotta dream big XD)
